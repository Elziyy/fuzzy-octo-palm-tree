// In C++, all code is written in functions. Main is a special function: it is
// the function that actually gets ran whenever you run the code. You can call
// functions from other functions.

// A function is declared like this:
int main() {

  // The return type is int, because at the end of the function it returns an
  // int (0, in this case). If it returns 0 to the terminal, that means that no
  // errors were found.

  // In C++, every line ends in a semicolon (;), if you don't, the compiler will
  // think that the rest of the line of code is on the following line.

  // And that is the very beginning! This isn't so hard right?

  // Oh wait there is the return 0 from earlier. If you look at the debug
  // console, it should say that the code was exited with code 0.

  return 0;
